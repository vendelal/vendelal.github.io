			<h2><span>1 </span>Ideating</h2>
			<p>The first step in creating a website is to think of 
			ideas for how to tackle the solution. These ideas
			can be as broad or as narrow as you want. For
			example, when working on the Boston UX Army
			landing page, my client and I started bouncing
			ideas off each other to reach a solution we were
			happy with. He did not want it to feel military,
			but wanted the title to be prominent.</p>

			<p><em>UI:</em> short for "user interface." The user interface can arguably include the total "user experience," which may include the aesthetic appearance of the device, response time, and the content that is presented to the user within the context of the user interface.

			<h2><span>2 </span>Brainstorming words and moods</h2>
			<p>It is important to think of how the end result will
			feel and make sure that the theme/mood of it is
			relevant. It was very important that the Boston UX
			Army website did not feel military, but it needed to
			have a professional, modern, and simple feel. These
			words (“professional,” “modern,” and “simple”) all
			help to guide the aesthetic we will use.</p>

			<h2><span>3 </span>Wireframing</h2>
			<p>Once the feeling, and content is decided upon, I start
			wireframing. This part of the process can be compared
			to making a line drawing before you fill it in with the 
			shading and colors. This is the step where I make sure 
			that the flow and usability of the website are solid.
			If you click on the “submit” button, what will be on the
			screen and where will it take you? What information
			is the most important?<br /><br />
			I mockup these pages with simple boxes, lines and simple
			typography hierarchy, but don't focus on the pretty details.</p>

			<p><em>Wireframing:</em> a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys.

			<h2><span>4 </span>High-fidelity mockups</h2>
			<p>Once the usability is fool-proof, it is time to fill in
			all the fonts, colors, and styles that will make up the
			design. This is the step where you can have fun and
			put your own flair on things. I like to start by keeping
			it simple and adding detail and unique elements
			where it seems appropriate. My main goal is always
			for something to look nice while keeping its core
			functionality clear.</p>

			<h2><span>5 </span>HTML</h2>
			<p>Once my content is set, my designs are complete,
			and I know how I want everything to work, I start to
			code. To begin, I usually set up all my HTML code.
			This part of the code is the content’s skeleton. It is
			equivalent to the wireframes because it is unstyled
			and only shows the content. This allows me to make
			sure I have all of the components before I set my
			focus on making it loo the way I want it to.</p>

			<h2><span>6 </span>CSS / Javascript</h2>
			<p>The final step of the process is to fill in the styles
			and functionality with CSS and Javascript. These
			are the coding languages that allow you to customize
			the look and feel of the page you are creating. Here you
			can decide how big a section is, what the font sizes are,
			what color the background is, etc. When you are done
			with this step which takes a lot of pixel pushing and
			perfecting, you have a final product!</p>
