            <p style="margin: 50px 0px; text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">
              Now, more than ever, is time to recognize the strong women — past and present —  that have pushed society’s limits, broken glass ceilings, and paved the way for future generations. These women are trailblazers, whether it be in government, fashion, tech, music, law or&nbsp;education. 
              <br /><br />
              Unfortunately, we recently lost the opportunity to have the first female President of the United States. If more women follow the lead of these illustrated, it won’t be long before we have another.  From HRC herself — “Now, I know, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but someday someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right&nbsp;now.”
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">First thing's first</p>
            <p>No, #badbitches is not degatory. No, we are not trying to be cool (okay, maybe a little, but we’d prefer “socially relevant”). No, we are not suggesting that any of these extremely accomplished, innovative women are bitches. We simply respect them, look up to them, and want to be them. This makes them&nbsp;#badbitches.</p>
            <br />
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why cards?</p>
            <p>Well… why not? Early decks of cards had no Queens, which reflected that all courts were male-dominated. Even today Italian, Spanish and German cards have a variation of 3 male court cards, with no Queen. The exception is the French,
              which does have a Queen (PRAISE). Card games are typically male-dominated, so we figured it’s time to bring some
              powerful women into the&nbsp;space. 
              <br /><br />
              Each card features an accomplished, kind, #badbitch. Our hope is that they are used, that people learn about these
              women (some of which are well known, some of which aren’t), and that they inspire the next generation of powerful do-ers, movers and shakers who also happen to be&nbsp;female.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">“Bad bitches” like French Montana’s song?</p>
            <p>because of their physique, material taste, or love for rap. I also would be surprised to see any of these women walking
              up in the club and getting “tooted”&nbsp;on.</p>
              <br />
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can I buy the cards?</p>
            <p>Yes! We are currently accepting pre-orders, you can join the list here. Why pre-orders? Well, this is a self-funded project,
              and considering we’re all recent grads, well… we ain’t got money for&nbsp;that.</p>
              <br />
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Ugh! You didn’t use my favorite #badbitch.</p>
            <p>Sorry! We wittled it down from 200+ women to 52… it was very difficult. If you’d like to nominate a #badbitch, you can 
              email us and nominate them for the next&nbsp;deck.</p>
              <br />
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Are you guys only doing this because Hillary lost the election?</p>
            <p>Yes… and no. We’ve been working on this for a while, but were hoping that HRC would win. Once she didn’t, we decided to release it sooner.However, you’ll notice that the women on this list cover a wide range of political beliefs, from ultra-conservative to ultra-liberal. This isn’t political, it’s about womens&nbsp;empowerment.</p>
            <br />
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can I share this?</p>
            <p>Yes! Please do! We did this to spread knowledge and create more enthusiasm about accomplished&nbsp;women.</p>
